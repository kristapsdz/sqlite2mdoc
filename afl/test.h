** ^The sqlite3_threadsafe() function returns zero if and only if

**
** SQLite can be compiled with or without mutexes.  When
** the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] C preprocessor macro is 1 or 2, mutexes
** are enabled and SQLite is threadsafe.  When the
** [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro is 0, 
** the mutexes are omitted.  Without the mutexes, it is not safe
** to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.
**
** Enabling mutexes incurs a measurable performance penalty.
** So if speed is of utmost importance, it makes sense to disable
** the mutexes.  But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled.
** ^The default behavior is for mutexes to be enabled.
**
** This interface can be used by an application to make sure that the
** version of SQLite that it is linking against was compiled with
** the desired setting of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] macro.
**
** This interface only reports on the compile-time mutex setting
** of the [SQLITE_THREADSAFE] flag.  If SQLite is compiled with
