.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_enable_load_extension
.Nd Enable Or Disable Extension Loading
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Ft int
.Fo sqlite3_enable_load_extension
.Fa "sqlite3 *db"
.Fa "int onoff"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
So as not to open security holes in older applications that are unprepared
to deal with extension loading, and as a means of
disabling extension loading while evaluating user-entered
SQL, the following API is provided to turn the
.Fn sqlite3_load_extension
mechanism on and off.
.Pp
Extension loading is off by default.
Call the sqlite3_enable_load_extension() routine with onoff==1 to turn
extension loading on and call it with onoff==0 to turn it back off
again.
.Pp
This interface enables or disables both the C-API
.Fn sqlite3_load_extension
and the SQL function
.Fn load_extension .
Use sqlite3_db_config(db,SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION,..)
to enable or disable only the C-API.
.Pp
\fBSecurity warning:\fP It is recommended that extension loading be disabled
using the SQLITE_DBCONFIG_ENABLE_LOAD_EXTENSION
method rather than this interface, so the
.Fn load_extension
SQL function remains disabled.
This will prevent SQL injections from giving attackers access to extension
loading capabilities.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 6274.
