.It SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC
The SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC flag means that the new function always gives
the same output when the input parameters are the same.
The abs() function is deterministic, for example, but
randomblob() is not.
Functions must be deterministic in order to be used in certain contexts
such as with the WHERE clause of partial indexes or
in generated columns.
SQLite might also optimize deterministic functions by factoring them
out of inner loops.
.It SQLITE_DIRECTONLY
The SQLITE_DIRECTONLY flag means that the function may only be invoked
from top-level SQL, and cannot be used in VIEWs or TRIGGERs nor in
schema structures such as CHECK constraints, DEFAULT clauses,
expression indexes, partial indexes,
or generated columns.
.Pp
The SQLITE_DIRECTONLY flag is recommended for any application-defined SQL function
that has side-effects or that could potentially leak sensitive information.
This will prevent attacks in which an application is tricked into using
a database file that has had its schema surreptiously modified to invoke
the application-defined function in ways that are harmful.
.Pp
Some people say it is good practice to set SQLITE_DIRECTONLY on all
application-defined SQL functions,
regardless of whether or not they are security sensitive, as doing
so prevents those functions from being used inside of the database
schema, and thus ensures that the database can be inspected and modified
using generic tools (such as the CLI) that do not have access to
the application-defined functions.
.It SQLITE_INNOCUOUS
The SQLITE_INNOCUOUS flag means that the function is unlikely to cause
problems even if misused.
An innocuous function should have no side effects and should not depend
on any values other than its input parameters.
The abs() function is an example of an innocuous function.
The load_extension() SQL function is not
innocuous because of its side effects.
.Pp
SQLITE_INNOCUOUS is similar to SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC, but is not exactly
the same.
The random() function is an example of a function
that is innocuous but not deterministic.
.Pp
Some heightened security settings (SQLITE_DBCONFIG_TRUSTED_SCHEMA
and PRAGMA trusted_schema=OFF) disable the
use of SQL functions inside views and triggers and in schema structures
such as CHECK constraints, DEFAULT clauses,
expression indexes, partial indexes,
and generated columns unless the function is tagged
with SQLITE_INNOCUOUS.
Most built-in functions are innocuous.
Developers are advised to avoid using the SQLITE_INNOCUOUS flag for
application-defined functions unless the function has been carefully
audited and found to be free of potentially security-adverse side-effects
and information-leaks.
.It SQLITE_SUBTYPE
The SQLITE_SUBTYPE flag indicates to SQLite that a function may call
.Fn sqlite3_value_subtype
to inspect the sub-types of its arguments.
Specifying this flag makes no difference for scalar or aggregate user
functions.
However, if it is not specified for a user-defined window function,
then any sub-types belonging to arguments passed to the window function
may be discarded before the window function is called (i.e. sqlite3_value_subtype()
will always return 0).
