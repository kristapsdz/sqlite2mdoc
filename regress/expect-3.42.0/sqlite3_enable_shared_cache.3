.Sh DESCRIPTION
This routine enables or disables the sharing of the database cache
and schema data structures between connections to the same
database.
Sharing is enabled if the argument is true and disabled if the argument
is false.
.Pp
This interface is omitted if SQLite is compiled with -DSQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE.
The -DSQLITE_OMIT_SHARED_CACHE compile-time
option is recommended because the use of shared cache mode is discouraged.
.Pp
Cache sharing is enabled and disabled for an entire process.
This is a change as of SQLite version 3.5.0 (dateof:3.5.0).
In prior versions of SQLite, sharing was enabled or disabled for each
thread separately.
.Pp
The cache sharing mode set by this interface effects all subsequent
calls to
.Fn sqlite3_open ,
.Fn sqlite3_open_v2 ,
and
.Fn sqlite3_open16 .
Existing database connections continue to use the sharing mode that
was in effect at the time they were opened.
.Pp
This routine returns SQLITE_OK if shared cache was enabled
or disabled successfully.
An error code is returned otherwise.
.Pp
Shared cache is disabled by default.
It is recommended that it stay that way.
In other words, do not use this routine.
This interface continues to be provided for historical compatibility,
but its use is discouraged.
Any use of shared cache is discouraged.
If shared cache must be used, it is recommended that shared cache only
be enabled for individual database connections using the
.Fn sqlite3_open_v2
interface with the SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
.Pp
Note: This method is disabled on MacOS X 10.7 and iOS version 5.0 and
will always return SQLITE_MISUSE.
On those systems, shared cache mode should be enabled per-database
connection via
.Fn sqlite3_open_v2
with SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE.
.Pp
This interface is threadsafe on processors where writing a 32-bit integer
is atomic.
