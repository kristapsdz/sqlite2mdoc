.Sh DESCRIPTION
Attempt to return the underlying operating system error code or error
number that caused the most recent I/O error or failure to open a file.
The return value is OS-dependent.
For example, on unix systems, after
.Fn sqlite3_open_v2
returns SQLITE_CANTOPEN, this interface could be called
to get back the underlying "errno" that caused the problem, such as
ENOSPC, EAUTH, EISDIR, and so forth.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 9099.
