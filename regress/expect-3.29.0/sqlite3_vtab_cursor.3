.Sh NAME
.Nm sqlite3_vtab_cursor
.Nd Virtual Table Cursor Object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Vt struct sqlite3_vtab_cursor ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Every virtual table module implementation uses
a subclass of the following structure to describe cursors that point
into the virtual table and are used to loop through the
virtual table.
Cursors are created using the xOpen method of the module and are
destroyed by the xClose method.
Cursors are used by the xFilter, xNext, xEof, xColumn,
and xRowid methods of the module.
Each module implementation will define the content of a cursor structure
to suit its own needs.
.Pp
This superclass exists in order to define fields of the cursor that
are common to all implementations.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 6656.
.Bd -literal
struct sqlite3_vtab_cursor {
  sqlite3_vtab *pVtab;      /* Virtual table of this cursor */
  /* Virtual table implementations will typically add additional fields */
