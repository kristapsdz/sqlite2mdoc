.Sh NAME
.Nm SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY
.Nd flags for sqlite3_serialize
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Fd #define SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Zero or more of the following constants can be OR-ed together for the
F argument to sqlite3_serialize(D,S,P,F).
.Pp
SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY means that
.Fn sqlite3_serialize
will return a pointer to contiguous in-memory database that it is currently
using, without making a copy of the database.
If SQLite is not currently using a contiguous in-memory database, then
this option causes
.Fn sqlite3_serialize
to return a NULL pointer.
SQLite will only be using a contiguous in-memory database if it has
been initialized by a prior call to
.Fn sqlite3_deserialize .
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 9344.
.Bd -literal
#define SQLITE_SERIALIZE_NOCOPY 0x001   /* Do no memory allocations */
