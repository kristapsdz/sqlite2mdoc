.Sh DESCRIPTION
The sqlite3_db_filename(D,N) interface returns a pointer to a filename
associated with database N of connection D.
The main database file has the name "main".
If there is no attached database N on the database connection D, or
if database N is a temporary or in-memory database, then this function
will return either a NULL pointer or an empty string.
.Pp
The filename returned by this function is the output of the xFullPathname
method of the VFS.
In other words, the filename will be an absolute pathname, even if
the filename used to open the database originally was a URI or relative
pathname.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 5862.
