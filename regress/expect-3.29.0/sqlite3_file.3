.Nd OS interface open file handle
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sqlite3.h
.Vt typedef struct sqlite3_file sqlite3_file;
.Vt struct sqlite3_file ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
An sqlite3_file object represents an open file in the OS interface layer.
Individual OS interface implementations will want to subclass this
object by appending additional fields for their own use.
The pMethods entry is a pointer to an sqlite3_io_methods
object that defines methods for performing I/O operations on the open
file.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 667.
.Bd -literal
typedef struct sqlite3_file sqlite3_file;
struct sqlite3_file {
  const struct sqlite3_io_methods *pMethods;  /* Methods for an open file */
};
