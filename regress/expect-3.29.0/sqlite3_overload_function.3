.Sh DESCRIPTION
Virtual tables can provide alternative implementations of functions
using the xFindFunction method of the virtual table module.
But global versions of those functions must exist in order to be overloaded.
.Pp
This API makes sure a global version of a function with a particular
name and number of parameters exists.
If no such function exists before this API is called, a new function
is created.
The implementation of the new function always causes an exception to
be thrown.
So the new function is not good for anything by itself.
Its only purpose is to be a placeholder function that can be overloaded
by a virtual table.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
These declarations were extracted from the
interface documentation at line 6688.
